>>> from mongokit import Connection

>>> con = Connection()

Let's say we have previously created 3 MongoDocuments : Blog, BlogPost and User.
Those objects have to be rechable via the connections so we register them :

>>> con.register([Blog, BlogPost, User])

and now, we can play. All begin via the connection `con`. Just like the pymongo
api, we get to the collection Via the connection and the db.

>>> con.mongokit.tutorial.find()

In this line, we query the collection named 'tutorial' (which is attached to the
db named 'mongokit') and fetch all documents in the collection (the pymongo's way).

Now enter the MongoDocument objects. Let's create a blog post:

    >>> blogpost = con.mongokit.tutorial.BlogPost()
    >>> blogpost['title'] = u'my title'
    >>> blogpost['body'] = u'a body'
    >>> blogpost['author'] = u'me'
    >>> blogpost.save()

Note that this is quite the same as the current api. We just get the BlogPost object
via the collection. The main advantage of this approche is that we don't have to
bother about the collection.

Note that we can simulate the current api behavior by getting the BlogPost object
before :

    >>> BlogPost = con.mongokit.tutorial.BlogPost
    >>> blogpost = BlogPost()
    >>> blogpost2 = BlogPost()

Another advantage is the ability of using the collection dynamically without pain.
Let's say that we want to put all BlogPost into a user collection (so one collection
by user) :

    >>> user_col = 'me'
    >>> blogpost = con.mongokit[user_col].BlogPost()

Quering is as simple as instanciating object. There's two way of fetching objects :

 * getting raw data (the pymongo's way)
 * getting instanciated object with all method defined (the mongokit way)

The first approche will produce only python dict and is very fast.
The seconde will wrap the data into the MongoDocument. This is useful if we defined
methods and want to use them.

Getting raw data :

    >>> raw_data = con.mongokit.tutorial.find()

Actually, all pymongo's method can be apply :
    
    >>> con.mongokit.tutorial.remove({})
    >>> con.mongokit.drop_collection('tutorial')

Getting instanciated objects :

    >>> blogpost_cursor = con.mongokit.tutorial.BlogPost.find()
    >>> bp = blogpost_cursor.next()

We can apply MongoDocument methods (`validate`, `to_json` etc...)

    >>> bp.validate()
    >>> bp
    {'body': u'a body', 'title': u'my title', 'date_creation': datetime.datetime(...), 'rank': 0, 'author': u'me'}

Other mongokit queries are available :

    >>> blogpost_cursor = con.mongokit.tutorial.BlogPost.fetch() # get only BlogPost
